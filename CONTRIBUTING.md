## How to Contribute

### 1. Add New Platform Commands

The easiest way to contribute is adding support for new platforms.

**Steps:**
1. Create a new command file: `publisher-plugin/commands/[platform].md`
2. Follow the existing command structure (see `x.md` as reference)
3. Add universal input detection (markdown, PDF, URL, slug)
4. Update README.md with examples
5. Test thoroughly with actual blog content
6. Submit a PR

**Good platforms to add:**
- Reddit post generator
- Bluesky thread generator
- Hacker News comment formatter
- Email newsletter version
- Substack formatter

### 2. Improve Existing Commands

**Ideas:**
- Better prompt templates
- More platform-specific optimizations
- Improved error handling
- Better input detection
- Support for more file formats

### 3. Test with Different Blog Structures

Help us support more blog setups:
- Test with Gatsby, Next.js, Astro, Hugo, etc.
- Report issues with specific blog structures
- Suggest improvements for auto-detection

### 4. Documentation

- Add more examples
- Improve installation instructions
- Add screenshots
- Write tutorials
- Fix typos
